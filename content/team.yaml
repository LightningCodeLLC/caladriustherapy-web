        Progress in life is a process. To move forward, sometimes you have
        to look back to see how much progress you have made, but you must
        also look ahead to see how much more progress remains. This
        process doesn't come without bumps and bruises. It can produce
        feelings of anxiety, anger, or depression, and sometimes we may
        lose loved ones or damage relationships while on our journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter where you are on your journey, I am here to help you
        process those traumatic experiences, those sleepless nights that
        keep you up, and the moments that prevent you from being present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Progress awaits you with open arms. Trust and give yourself grace
        along the way. Therapy can be scary. Perhaps this isn't your first
        time attending therapy. Or maybe, therapy is not common in your
        community and you never even considered it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We all deserve the feeling of being present, inspired, and happy.
        I'm here to guide you along your journey to help you reach that.
        Together we will get to the root of your challenges to help you
        find clarity and embrace your authentic self.I will provide a
        person-centered approach that meets you where you are and allows
        you a space where you will have grace to process, cry, and laugh,
        as you come back home to yourself.

    bio:
      <p>
        I chose a career in mental health because I understand that humans
        are hardwired for connection but life can sometimes leave us
        feeling disconnected. I chose to go into clinical social work to
        help people through suffering, to help people reconnect with
        themselves and the people that matter most to them, and to help
        people make the positive changes they need to live the life that
        is most fulfilling for them. I am most passionate about helping
        people make connections about their past experiences/upbringing to
        increase their self-awareness and cultivate self-compassion for
        the struggles they are facing in the present moment. Giving people
        a place to process whatever they need to process, without any fear
        of judgment, where they feel understood, accepted, valued, and
        safe. Empowering people to take action to get their wants and
        needs met in their relationships (romantic, platonic, and
        familial). I strive to empower and support all patients to make
        the changes necessary for them to meet their goals through the
        cultivation of understanding, awareness, and self-compassion. I
        will meet people where they are, go as fast or as slow as they
        need to go and focus on the topics/issues they prioritize. I
        structure therapy sessions to meet the unique needs and
        preferences of each client because there is no one-size-fits-all.
        The quality of the therapeutic relationship is of the utmost
        importance to me, so I check in with my patients on a regular
        basis to invite feedback and encourage open communication.

        Starting therapy can be extremely daunting. The mere act of seeking support asks us to acknowledge that something needs our attention. My goal as a therapist is to create a soft and nonjudgmental space for individuals and families to attend to pain and move towards healing. I utilize a person-centered, trauma-informed approach to create spaces where vulnerability feels accessible and empowering. You are the expert of your experience and it is my hope that you feel this throughout our time together.

        Therapy is a transformative journey. It is one in which we begin
        to take off the masks that we are afraid of living without but
        know we cannot live within. Together, we will gently remove old
        and new masks, allowing for the opportunity to get to know our
        truest, inner selves. From witnessing how personal challenges -
        past and present - can impact individuals in distinct ways, I have
        grown increasingly passionate about helping individuals to
        reconnect with life through self-discovery. I use a
        person-centered, trauma informed approach that recognizes and
        respects you, in all of your glorious uniqueness. I believe you
        are the expert in your lived experiences and I work to create a

        express their emotions constructively through play, their most
        effective language. With adolescents, I focus on establishing
        trust and connection while addressing challenging behaviors and
        developing valuable skills within, such as self regulation and
        self compassion. When working with adults, I focus on wellness and
        stability, while guiding you through your healing journey and
        equipping you with resources and tools to use both inside and
        outside of sessions. I draw heavily from CBT, responsive
        parenting, attachment theory, and other trauma-informed practices
        to meet your specific needs and desires. I also enjoy
        incorporating mindfulness, meditation, and body focused practices
        to connect the mind, body, and spirit, into sessions.

    bio:
      <p>
        Relationships are foundational to our experience. Connection,
        intimacy, authenticity, and feelings of safety are all tied into
        the relationships formed with ourselves, loved ones, our
        communities, and even the natural world. These interactions, or
        lack thereof, shape our stories, and affirm the kind of narratives
        we tell ourselves about the world around us. As a relational
        therapist, I recognize that you and I are entering a relationship
        of our own. It is my goal to nurture a working alliance that is
        honest, trusting, and collaborative. One in which you will have a
        safe holding space as we explore the difficulties and
        vulnerabilities that brought you to therapy.
      </p>
      <p>
        If relationships are the chapters within our stories, identity is
        the color and context that fills the pages. Our intersecting roles
        and identities are interwoven together to create the unique
        values, beliefs, customs, and systems of being. Growing up as the
        oldest child to Caribbean immigrants, I appreciate how these
        sometimes conflicting parts of self have informed my experience. I
        also know first hand that stigma and lack of access to mental
        health services are still pervasive. I firmly believe that my work
        as a therapist extends beyond the individual sitting in the
        therapy room but to the systems they are a part of as a whole. I
        welcome all conversations about how your experiences have impacted
        your journey.

    bio:
      <p>
        Growing up a queer kid in a rural area shaped the person I am
        today. In my adulthood, I became aware of the power of my own
        resilience, and the protective factors that enabled me to get to
        where I am today. I want to help other people who have been
        through difficult experiences discover the power of their own
        resilience as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        We might be a good fit if you're struggling with personal
        relationships or feeling alone in your journey. You may be stuck
        in a painful past or struggling with sorting out who you are. You
        might be searching for a different perspective or someone to
        validate your experience. I believe in the power of building up
        your resiliency toolbox and finding light at the end of the tunnel
        together. Each life stage and relationship offers different
        rewards and challenges that I enjoy working with. Navigating those
        life stages can be more complex for those struggling with identity
        and social ostracization. The LGBTQIA+ community is the most near
        and dear to my heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        I offer a unique clinical and lived experience with a wide variety
        of complex issues and populations. My clinical instinct operates
        through a systemic lens. I come from a background working with
        families to address tough issues related to juvenile justice and
        DSS involvement. I enjoy helping people find relief and a better
        way forward. I also enjoy going deep and helping people make sense
        of their root traumas that may be holding them back. I enjoy
        practical application and skill-building through CBT and DBT
        modalities. Much of my experience has been assisting people with
        finding and practicing communication and coping skills to
        strengthen their relationships with family, friends, and
        themselves. I am passionate about helping families and couples
        have difficult, but necessary conversations. I often challenge my
        clients to consider circumstances from different angles and guide
        them out of their comfort zones.

            “There is no greater work human hands can do than to hold a
            child with a fierce tenderness that says in a way words never
            can: 'you are loved', 'you are safe', 'you can trust'.”
          </em>
          -Parker Palmer
        </p>
        <p>
          Every child deserves to be a child - to feel safe, loved, and to
          experience the world through a lens filled with wonder, joy and
          curiosity. When trauma occurs, it can affect every fiber of a
          child's being, causing chaos and disruption to their childhood. It
          can often feel impossible to know where to begin to start the
          healing process. That is why I am here - to help your child
          untangle and process the jumbled and complicated emotions that
          trauma can cause. Through processing with your child, we will
          explore emotions and experiences that will help them heal,
          increase their sense of safety and security, and learn skills to
          help them cope with intense moments of emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use a child-centered approach, meaning I meet each child where
          they are with empathy and understanding, taking into account every
          factor playing a role in their life. In the playroom, your child
          gets to be fully, authentically them - without judgement and
          taking the lead. In play therapy, we use the language that all
          children are fluent in - play. Finding words to fully express how
          trauma has affected an individual is difficult for anyone,
          especially a child who might not yet have the vocabulary to
          process their experiences.The playroom is a place for the child to
          experience control over the situations and emotions in their life
          that produce chaos and unease, all the while feeling in their
          element, surrounded by toys, games, and books familiar to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your child and family's stories are precious and deserve to be
          held with the utmost respect. To be entrusted to walk alongside
          you and your child as they navigate their past stories, their
          current stories, and their future stories is the greatest honor.

    bio:
      <p>
        Motherhood (and fatherhood!) looks different on everyone. My
        passion for maternal mental health sparked after having my
        daughter and I was able to fully appreciate the challenges and
        range of emotions that surface within parenthood from a lived
        experience. I then sought to specialize in Perinatal Mental Health
        to shift my focus from counseling children to counseling parents.
        When most people hear about Perinatal Mental Health, they often
        think of postpartum depression- but Perinatal Mental Health
        encompasses so much more than that! I work with women in all
        stages of parenthood including infertility, grief, and loss. I am
        here to help you navigate challenges and emotions that may arise
        in pregnancy, birth, and parenthood- including helping you explore
        bonding with your baby, navigating those terrible twos, parenting
        threenagers, and staying true to yourself as a parent through the
        child and adolescent years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Becoming a parent often changes your identity, but it should never
        feel like you've lost yourself. Each stage brings new challenges
        and new things to enjoy and it seems as soon as you adjust to one
        stage, a new one is just around the corner! Those of us parenting
        without clear role models of the kind of parent we want to be face
        additional challenges and can benefit greatly from support to make
        their parenting goals and vision a reality. I am here to partner
        with you to maintain your sense of self, your mental health, and
        provide support as we navigate it together.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as providing support to parents, I want to continue my
        work providing care to children and adolescents. During my five
        years of experience working as a school social worker, I have
        experience providing children with support identifying and naming
        their emotions, positive coping skills, working through
        depression, self harm, and suicidality, and providing crisis
        support. I enjoy working with children going through family
        transitions, parent separation, and social anxiety.

  #   bio:
  #     <p>
  #       Often, people experience stress and anxiety if they believe they do not live up to others' expectations of them. It can feel extremely isolating if you think you are outside of the "normal". I believe that "normal" is subjective, and that there is no standard "normal". I enjoy working with clients who are wanting to embrace the parts of themselves that they've been conditioned to keep private.
  #     </p>
  #     <p>
  #       I see strength in vulnerability. I think there is so much to be said for a person who is able to acknowledge the pain that they've been through. Without doing so, it can be difficult to learn, heal, and grow.
  #     </p>
  #     <p>
  #       Certain events in our lives can alter the way we view ourselves, others, and the world around us. We all deserve peace. We all deserve to feel safe. We all deserve to feel whole. As humans, we were not made to carry our burdens alone. I am here to help you process your trauma as you rediscover yourself. I can teach you coping skills and offer support.
  #     </p>
  #     <p>
  #       I offer a person-centered approach and incorporate skills of CBT, DBT, ACT, and other modalities into my practice. Additionally, I am able to perform EMDR, which is an evidence-based treatment that is recommended to treat trauma, anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns. I also have a therapy dog named Kay. She is the goodest girl/co-worker.  She is an English golden retriever who can sit in on session upon request. 
  #     </p>
  #     <p>
  #       The intersection between trauma and identity cannot be denied. As a queer woman, I am also passionate about helping LGBTQ+ individuals navigate their traumatic life events. Additionally, I am passionate about helping those who have been impacted by image-based sexual abuse. 
  #     </p>
  #     <p>
  #       I am here to remind you that you are not what happened to you. I am here to help you recognize and hone in on your resilience and strength.

  #       level of effort in all areas of our life. This leaves us feeling
  #       down, feeling stressed, struggling to manage our emotions, hurting
  #       relationships we do not mean to, and putting our needs and
  #       self-care on the back burner. We often feel a sense of imposter
  #       syndrome where we believe we do not deserve the success and
  #       happiness we are experiencing; it becomes a barrier created by us
  #       and affects our ability to achieve success and happiness.

      <p>
        Feeling uncomfortable is a signal that it is time for us to start
        our own process of change. Starting this path of working through
        difficult or emotional challenges sometimes requires deep
        vulnerability. Opening up and being vulnerable with someone else
        can be intimidating, but once practiced, it can also be
        liberating! You may have had things happen to you that were unfair
        and painful, causing conflict within yourself or with others. It
        is especially difficult when you feel alone without someone you
        can talk to, who will listen without judgment. When you feel
        overwhelmed and you are experiencing trials that are difficult to
        navigate, it is time to reach out for support.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my journey towards becoming a therapist because I know
        that life can be hard and sometimes it feels like a never-ending
        uphill battle. I am here to provide added support during this
        time, to give you the space to be vulnerable, heard, and to share
        tools that can be helpful to you. My goal is to help you feel
        empowered to seek growth, acceptance, and peace within yourself.
        Sometimes you just need someone to talk to, and other times you
        might need help learning new coping skills. I hope to be that
        trusted person you can share your thoughts and feelings with, as
        well as practice new skills to be implemented in your everyday
        life.
