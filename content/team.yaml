        Therapy is a transformative journey. It is one in which we begin
        to take off the masks that we are afraid of living without but
        know we cannot live within. Together, we will gently remove old
        and new masks, allowing for the opportunity to get to know our
        truest, inner selves. From witnessing how personal challenges -
        past and present - can impact individuals in distinct ways, I have
        grown increasingly passionate about helping individuals to
        reconnect with life through self-discovery. I use a
        person-centered, trauma informed approach that recognizes and
        respects you, in all of your glorious uniqueness. I believe you
        are the expert in your lived experiences and I work to create a
        space where you can share your journey, challenges, and hopes for
        the future.

        With over five years of experience working with youth experiencing
        foster care, I have a special interest in helping children (and
        families) navigate the various emotions that arise due to the
        circumstances they are faced with. I help children understand and
        express their emotions constructively through play, their most
        effective language. With adolescents, I focus on establishing
        trust and connection while addressing challenging behaviors and
        developing valuable skills within, such as self regulation and
        self compassion. When working with adults, I focus on wellness and
        stability, while guiding you through your healing journey and
        equipping you with resources and tools to use both inside and
        outside of sessions. I draw heavily from CBT, responsive
        parenting, attachment theory, and other trauma-informed practices
        to meet your specific needs and desires. I also enjoy
        incorporating mindfulness, meditation, and body focused practices
        to connect the mind, body, and spirit, into sessions.

        Progress in life is a process. To move forward, sometimes you have to look back to see how much progress you have made, but you must also look ahead to see how much more progress remains. This process doesn't come without bumps and bruises. It can produce feelings of anxiety, anger, or depression, and sometimes we may lose loved ones or damage relationships while on our journey.

        <p>
          No matter where you are on your journey, I am here to help you process those traumatic experiences, those sleepless nights that keep you up, and the moments that prevent you from being present.
        </p>
        <p>
          Progress awaits you with open arms. Trust and give yourself grace along the way. Therapy can be scary. Perhaps this isn't your first time attending therapy. Or maybe, therapy is not common in your community and you never even considered it.
        </p>  
        <p>
          We all deserve the feeling of being present, inspired, and happy. I'm here to guide you along your journey to help you reach that. Together we will get to the root of your challenges to help you find clarity and embrace your authentic self.I will provide a person-centered approach that meets you where you are and allows you a space where you will have grace to process, cry, and laugh, as you come back home to yourself.
